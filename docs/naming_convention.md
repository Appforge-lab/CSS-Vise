# NAMING CONVENTION

Forge uses a unique naming convention with less hyphens, dashes and a style close to the default CSS naming system. The naming convention is based on the colon character ":" which is introduced exclusively in Forge framework. The latter makes it effortless to distinguish between the opcode and the operand in a class assignment.

```html
<div class="vise">	
    <div class="color:blue padding:2">
    <div class="color:black color-text:orange padding-sides:2">
</div>	
```
