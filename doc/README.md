# APPROACH

Vise is a simple yet powerful lightweight vanilla CSS framework forged with the following notions in mind:

- **Encaplsulation**

  Vise doesn't get influenced by other loaded frameworks on the same HTML document. Thus, it can be used alongside any other framework (Bootstrap, Foundation, Bluma, etc). Any HTML element enclosed within Vise's opening and closing tags looses any previous alternation and gets Vise's defaults. Any Vise class is only usable within Vise's scope and affects only child elements of Vise, leaving outer elements untouched.

- **Self-reliance**

  Packed with the basic features, Vise is functional out-of-the-box. With styled HTML elements, helper classes and a powerful grid system, Vise is a complete framework that can build simple and complex web content.

- **Minimalism**

  Vise is intended to be as minimal as possible while offering the basic features to build a consistent user experience. With around 30kb of size, Vise is one of the most lightweight frameworks. Based an a simple naming convention and powerful grid system, it forms a reliable starting point for any project.
