## Why Vise ?

There is dozens of CSS frameworks available but why Vise ?
.
- You may not need a **heavy** framework to build a great user experience.
- You may need a **minimal** but **functional** pure CSS framework.
- You may want to try a **smarter** and **more reliable** grid system.
- You may want to use **more than one** framework on the same HTML document.

## Introduction to Vise's Approach

Vise is not the usual CSS framework that is focused on only making styling a faster proccess, but also forged with the following notions in mind:

- **Encapsulation**

  Vise is self-enclosed, it doesn't get affected by previously loaded frameworks on the same HTML document. Thus it can be used alongside any other framework (Bootstrap, Foundation, Bulma, etc).

- **Self-reliance**

  Packed with the basic features, Vise is functional out-of-the-box. With styled HTML elements, helper classes and a smart grid system, Vise is a complete framework that can build simple and complex web contents.

- **Minimalism**

  Vise is meant to be minimal while offering necessary facilities to build a consistent user experience.
