## Why Vise

There is dozens of CSS frameworks available but why Vise ?

- You may not need a **heavy** framework to build a great user experience. 

- You may want to use **more than one** framework on the same HTML document.

- You may want a **smarter** and **easier** to learn minimal framework.
