A lightweight, minimal and mature vanilla CSS framework built with care. It can be used as a primary framework or as a secondary one alongside any other framework. Check [this demo page](http://appforgelab.com/vise/) for a quick showcase.

## Why Vise

There is dozens of CSS frameworks available but why Vise ?

- You may not need a **heavy** framework to build a great user experience. 

- You may want to use **more than one** framework on the same HTML document.

- You may want a **smarter** and **easier** to learn minimal framework.

- You need a library that is supported by **98%** of web browsers.

## Get Started

There are a couple ways to get Vise:

- [Download CSS-Vise-Beta-0.1 zip](https://github.com/Appforge-lab/css-vise/releases/download/Beta-0.1/css-vise.zip)
- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Appforge-lab/css-vise.git` 

To get started properly have a look on the [docs](https://github.com/Appforge-lab/css-vise/tree/master/docs).

## Approach

Vise is not the usual framework, it's not based only on making CSS styling a faster process but also forged with some notions in mind:

- **Encapsulation**

  Vise is self-enclosed, it doesn't get affected by previously loaded frameworks on the same HTML document. Thus it can be used alongside any other framework (Bootstrap, Foundation, Bulma, etc).

  Any element enclosed within Vise's opening and closing tags drops any previous alternation and gets Vise's defaults.

  Any Vise class is only usable within Vise's enclosure and affects only it's child elements, leaving outer elements untouched.

- **Self-reliance**

  Packed with the basic features, Vise is functional out-of-the-box. With styled HTML elements, helper classes and a smart grid system, Vise is a complete framework that can build simple and complex web contents.

- **Minimalism**

  Vise is meant to be minimal while offering the basic features to build a consistent user experience. With around 30kb of size, Vise is one of the most lightweight frameworks. Based on a simple naming convention and a powerful grid system, it forms a reliable starting point for your project.
